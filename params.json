It then evolved internally at my organization, Planet Technologies (www.go-planet.com) and finally expanded into the Git version with the assistance of Dobroslav Kolev also of Planet Technologies. Thanks to everyone for your help in getting this project off the ground. \r\n\r\n","tagline":"Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Wordpress Portal Plugin","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
